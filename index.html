        <h2>One of the worlds largest platforms for programming professionals and coding enthusiasts</h2>
        <p>
         Founded in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky, Stack Overlow has grown into one of the leading comminty-based question and answers websites for programming and coding. Over the years, a tight system of moderation, tags and collectives has been developed - all so that the content remains clear, serious and easily found. The plaftorm has also grown into several branches targeting specific needs: a knowledge-sharing service for teams, a platform for recruiting new talents and one for finding your next tech job as well as a public space for tech-related advertisements.</p>
